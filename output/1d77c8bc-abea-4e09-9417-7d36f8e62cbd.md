## Production Challenges

Filming *Jaws* presented numerous challenges, primarily due to the mechanical sharks, affectionately nicknamed "Bruce." These often malfunctioned, leading Spielberg to rely on suspenseful storytelling and John Williams' iconic score to create tension. The minimalist portrayal of the shark, coupled with effective sound design, drew comparisons to Alfred Hitchcock's techniques.

### Filming Locations and Techniques

The film was primarily shot on location in **Martha's Vineyard**, Massachusetts, from May to October 1974. The choice to film on location was significant, as it contributed to the film's authenticity and helped establish a realistic setting for the shark attacks. Spielberg’s decision to limit the shark's appearances and focus on the characters’ fear created a more intense atmosphere.
